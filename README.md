# **FreeCAD 3D Printing Projects**

## **Description**

This repository contains FreeCAD (.FCStd) files for various 3D printing projects. The models are designed to be easily printable on most common 3D printers. Each project aims to be parametric, allowing for customization of dimensions and features through FreeCAD's built-in parametric design capabilities.

**You will find models for:**

* \[fisher-SBX1530K-remote-holder-v2\]: (e.g., Remote Control Holder for Fisher SBX1530k) .

## **Features**

* **Parametric Design:** All models are created in FreeCAD, leveraging its parametric capabilities. This allows you to easily modify dimensions, tolerances, and other design parameters to fit your specific needs and printer.  
* **Print-Ready:** The models are designed with 3D printing in mind. Considerations are made for overhangs, bridging, and ease of assembly. STL files can be exported directly from the FreeCAD files.  
* **Open Source:** All designs are open-source and freely available for you to use, modify, and share.

## **Instructions**

1. **Download FreeCAD:** If you don't have it already, download and install FreeCAD (version 0.20 or later is recommended) from [https://www.freecadweb.org/](https://www.freecadweb.org/). FreeCAD is a free and open-source parametric 3D CAD modeler.  
2. **Download Project Files:** Clone this repository or download the specific project folder you are interested in. Each project will have its own folder containing the FreeCAD (.FCStd) file(s).  
3. **Open in FreeCAD:** Open the .FCStd file in FreeCAD.  
4. **Modify Parameters (Optional):**  
   * Double-click on the "Sketch" or "Body" in the tree view to edit the underlying sketches and features.  
   * Use the "Spreadsheet" workbench to modify parametric values. Many designs use a spreadsheet to define key dimensions. Double-click the spreadsheet in the tree view to edit the values.  
5. **Export to STL:**  
   * Select the final solid object in the tree view (usually the last feature created).  
   * Go to **File \> Export**.  
   * Choose **STL Mesh (\*.stl)** as the file format.  
   * Save the .STL file.  
6. **Slice and Print:** Use your preferred slicing software (e.g., Cura, PrusaSlicer, Simplify3D) to slice the .STL file and generate the G-code for your 3D printer. Adjust the slicing settings as needed for your printer and material.

## **Dependencies**

* [FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org/) (Version 0.20 or later recommended)

## **Contributing**

Contributions are welcome\! If you have FreeCAD designs you'd like to share, please follow these steps:

1. **Fork the Repository:** Fork this repository to your own GitHub account.  
2. **Create a New Branch:** Create a new branch for your project (e.g., feature/new-project-name).  
3. **Organize Your Project:**  
   * Create a new folder in the repository for your project. Use a descriptive name.  
   * Place your FreeCAD (.FCStd) file(s) and any other relevant files (e.g., images, documentation) in this folder.  
   * Ensure your FreeCAD file is well-organized, with clear names for sketches, pads, and other features. Use a spreadsheet for parameters whenever possible.  
4. **Add Project Information to README:** Add a new section for your project in this README.md file, following the format in the "Projects" section. Include a clear description, FreeCAD features used, 3D printing notes, customization instructions, and an image.  
5. **Commit and Push:** Commit your changes and push them to your fork.  
6. **Create a Pull Request:** Create a pull request to merge your branch into the main repository.
